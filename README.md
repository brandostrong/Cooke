# Cooke
## Info
An extremely modular discord bot. [Inspired by an IRC bot named Shocky](https://github.com/clone1018/Shocky), [which in turn was inspired by an IRC bot named Crow](https://github.com/lahwran/skybot), [a fork of Skybot](https://github.com/rmmh/skybot). Instead of programming through the bot's internal code, program the bot through discord. Commands can be written in Python through the chat client, and are stored within an internal database. 

Features include adding, removing, and listing commands, and has a fully function user and command whitelist. Commands can be fed any number of inputs, and are fully featured(with the exception of security and sandboxing). Add help info to your commands to make them more understandable!

Not up to date, and unmaintained for now, DM for more info.
